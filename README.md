### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Enrique CastaÃ±eda, a customer support professional with over 13 years of experience transitioning into the world of web development.

- ðŸ”­ I recently completed an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack, where I gained hands-on experience with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on solidifying my web development skills and exploring opportunities to leverage my technical aptitude and customer-centric background.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm open to roles in front-end development, full-stack development, and technical support where I can apply my problem-solving abilities and growing technical skillset.
